    Backend API for Virtual Cuppa application with email-based authentication and automatic matching system.

    ## Features
    - Email-based authentication with 6-digit codes
    - User tagging system for better matching
    - Automatic match generation every Monday at 9 AM
    - Manual match triggering for admins
    - Match acceptance/rejection workflow
    - SendGrid email notifications

    ## Matching System
    The system automatically generates matches between users based on:
    - **Tag compatibility**: Jaccard similarity (common tags / total unique tags × 100)
    - **User availability**: No pending matches
    - **Cooldown period**: 30-day minimum between same users
    - **One match per user**: Each user can have only one pending match at a time

    ### Match Acceptance Flow
    - **Two-step acceptance**: Both users must accept for the match to be fully accepted
    - Match remains **pending** until both users accept
    - If first user accepts, match stays pending for the second user
    - Once both accept, status changes to **accepted**
    - If either user rejects, status immediately changes to **rejected**

    ### Automatic Scheduler
    - Runs every **Monday at 9:00 AM**
    - Processes **all organisations** automatically
    - Can be manually triggered via `/api/admin/matches/trigger-scheduler`

    ## Email Notifications
    The system uses SendGrid with three email templates:

    1. **CONFIRM_CODE_TEMPLATE_ID**: 6-digit confirmation code
       - Sent during registration
       - Sent when user requests a new code
       - Dynamic data: `confirmCode`

    2. **INVITATION_TEMPLATE_ID**: User invitation
       - Sent when admin creates a new user
       - Dynamic data: `OrganisationName`

    3. **MATCH_NOTIFICATION_TEMPLATE_ID**: Match notification
       - Sent to both users when a match is created
       - Dynamic data: `MatchName` (other user's name), `Date`, `Time`, `MatchScore`

        - Returns matches with status "pending" (waiting for acceptance)
        - Returns matches with status "accepted" IF they haven't expired yet
        - Accepted matches expire 5 days after both users accept

        - Matches where both users have already submitted feedback are no longer considered "current"

        **Returns**:
        - Match details including the other user's information
        - Match score and scheduled date/time
        - Status ("pending" or "accepted")
        - Availabilities submitted by both users

        **Note**: Users can only have one current match at a time. After both users submit feedback,
        the system automatically tries to generate a new match for each user.

      summary: Submit feedback for a match
      description: |
        Submit rating and optional comment for a completed match.

        **Requirements**:
        - Match must have status "accepted" (both users accepted)
        - User must be one of the participants in the match
        - User must not have already submitted feedback for this match

        **Mandatory feedback**:
        - Both users should provide feedback after accepting a match
        - Use GET /api/matches/pending-feedback to see matches awaiting feedback

        **Rating impact**:
        - Rating updates the other user's averageRating field
        - Average is calculated from all feedbacks received

        **Automatic new match generation**:
        - When both users have submitted feedback, the system automatically tries to generate new matches for both users
        - If suitable candidates are found, new matches are created immediately
        - If no suitable candidates are available, users simply won't have a current match (no error)
        - Match generation is asynchronous and silent - it happens in the background

        **Note**: This endpoint generates matches only for the admin's organisation.
        For generating matches across all organisations, use `/api/admin/matches/trigger-scheduler`.

        **Eligibility criteria**:
        - User must be confirmed
        - User must not have a pending match
        - User must not have been matched with the same person in the last 30 days

        **Matching algorithm**:
        - Calculates match score based on tag similarity (Jaccard index)
        - Selects best non-conflicting pairs (each user appears max once)
        - Creates matches with random dates/times (weekdays, business hours)
        - Sends email notifications to both users

        Manually trigger the automatic match scheduler to generate matches for **all organisations** immediately.

        **Difference from `/api/admin/matches/generate`**:
        - This endpoint processes **all organisations** in the system
        - `/generate` only processes the admin's organisation

        **Scheduler behavior**:
        - Runs asynchronously in background
        - Iterates through all organisations
        - Generates matches for each organisation independently
        - Logs detailed information about the process

        **Normal schedule**: The scheduler runs automatically every Monday at 9:00 AM.
        This endpoint allows manual triggering for testing or emergency updates.
